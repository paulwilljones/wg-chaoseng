We expect to operate by rough consensus, however, if thereâ€™s an issue that cannot be resolved through rough consensus, we employ "organization voting" to ensure no single organization can dominate the project. Individuals not associated with or employed by a company or organization are allowed one organization vote. Each company or organization (regardless of the number of maintainers associated with or employed by that company/organization) receives one organization vote.
